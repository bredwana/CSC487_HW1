#Question 2: (A) , and (B)

#We need to set a seed to compare same population sample(10,000) in the 2 cases required in the question
set.seed(10000)
#We need the ggplot function to find the histogram for (A) section of the question

dfA<-data.frame(XA=rnorm(10000, 0, 0.2))
ggplot(dfA, aes(x=XA))+geom_histogram()+xlim(-5,5)

dfB<-data.frame(XB=rnorm(10000, 0, 0.5))
ggplot(dfB, aes(x=XB))+geom_histogram()+xlim(-5,5)
#Comment: the first Histogram is taller and more narrow which means that the data is concentrated closer to the mean and the second one is wider
#Reason: Both Histograms have the same mean but it is for the same number of data, but the standard deviation determined spreading of the data.

#Question 3:  (A) , (B) , (C) , (D) , (E), and(F)
#(A)

dat <- data.frame(cond = factor(rep(c("A","B"), each=200)), rating = c(rnorm(200),rnorm(200, mean=.8)))

#(FB) #Overlaid histograms : distributions of 2 classes in the same space. helpful looking for overlaps or specific differences in distributions.
ggplot(diabetes, aes(x=mass, fill= class)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, alpha=.5, position="identity")

#(FC) #Interleaved histograms: arranges the bars side by side. This setting is used when you want to compare different groups directly
ggplot(diabetes, aes(x=mass, fill=class)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5, position="dodge")

#(FD)# Density plots - using Color=
ggplot(diabetes, aes(x=mass, colour=class)) + geom_density()

#Question 4: (A) , (B), (C), (D) , and (E)
passengers <- read.delim("titanic.csv", header = TRUE, sep = "," )
library(tidyverse)
#(A) explanation: It removed all of the rows with missing values from the data frame passengers and the observations (obs) was reduced from 891 to 741 and assigned it to a new variable newpassenger. It then provided a statistical summary of the new data frame newpassenger for all 13 variables.
newpassenger<-passengers %>% drop_na()
newpassenger%>% summary()
#(B) explanation: it excluded all of the observations that contains sex= female (note: I used the data frame newpassenger because all na values have already been removed) and then I assigned it to a new data frame called malepassengers with 453 observations only.
library(dbplyr)
malepassengers<- newpassenger %>% filter(Sex == "male")
#(C) explanation: from the data frame newpassenger all observations were arranged from the biggest value of the attribute Fare to the smallest.
arrangepassenger<-newpassenger %>% arrange(desc(Fare))
#(D) explanation: the mutate function added a new variable or attribute to data frame newpassenger called FamSizepass and the values for each observation= adding the values of Parch and SibSp attribute for each observation.
FamSizepass <- newpassenger %>% mutate(FamSize = Parch + SibSp)
#(E) explanation: for each sex group(male-female) the summary will contain the mean of the Fare attribute and will be named meanFare using mean function and it will also contain the sum for each 
lastpassengers<-newpassenger %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare), numSurv = sum(Survived))
#Question 5:
#percentile 10th is quantile 0.1, and so on for the rest of the percentiles
quantile(diabetes$skin , c(.1 , .3 , .5 , .6))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
